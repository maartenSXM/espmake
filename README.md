# espmake

espmake assists with managing multiple esphome project variants that share
yaml source files.  espmake also enables the sharing of pin definitions
and configuration definitions between yaml and C / C++ files by enabling
the use of C preprocessor directives inside esphome yaml files. See
main.yaml, config.h and pins.h for examples of that.

espmake generates a new esphome home yaml file from an existing esphome
project.  The reason a new esphome yaml is generated is because espmake
runs the existing esphome project's yaml files through the
C-preprocessor (cpp) and leaves it available for review - and
for esphome to process.

Once a yaml file is generated by the Makefile,  esphome commands
can be issued upon it, such as:
```bash
 esphome compile myProj_0.yaml
 esphome upload  myProj_0.yaml
 esphome logs    myProj_0.yaml
```

See 'esphome -h' for more details on esphome commands.

## Installation

espmake is basically a Makefile in this directory which is manually copied
into an existing esphome project directory to enable the make command.
Note that this manual installation procedure assumes that the destination
project doesn't have a Makefile already. If it does, this Makefile could
be renamed and included from the project Makefile.  However that is left
as an exercise for the reader.

## Makefile User variables

These Makefile variables can be changed from their defaults by either
editting the Makefile or overriding them with an argument to make such as
```bash
make MAIN=init.yaml
```

### MAIN

The initial/main yaml file that includes the others. it defaults
to "main.yaml".

### PREFIX

espmake generates a single esphome yaml filename named $(PREFIX)$(PROJTAG).
PREFIX defaults to "./myProj_"

### PROJTAG

espmake generates a single esphome yaml filename named $(PREFIX)$(PROJTAG).
PROJTAG defaults to "0" but can be any character string of any length.
To build different project variants from the same esphome project
directory, specify a different PROJTAG for each.

Argument -D_PROJTAG_$(PROJTAG) is passed to the cpp by espmake so that
esphome yaml sources can vary using #if  directives such as:
```code
#if _PROJTAG_foo
# yaml code only for project foo goes here
#endif
```

## Generated files
espmake generates esphome project file <PREFIX><PROJTAG>.yaml
Intermediate C-preprocessed files used to generate <PREFIX><PROJTAG>.yaml
are stored in directory <PREFIX><PROJTAG>/

Both can be deleted using 'make clean'.

## Other

There are some additional comments describing Makefile features in the
Makefile.

There are some aliases in file Bashrc which may be helpful for issuing
esphome commands.

espmake uses a small github project called dehash
(https://github.com/maartenwrs/dehash) to remove hash-style comments
before running files through the c-preprocessor.

# Credits

Thank you to Landon Rohatensky for the exemplary esphome yaml file
https://github.com/landonr/lilygo-tdisplays3-esphome used to demonstrate
espmake configuration, build and also as used in the test subdirectory.

# Disclaimers

Tthe author has not attempted to use espmake with Visual Studio.

# MacOS Note
Note: on MacOS, you need GNU sed to run dehash.sh, which espmake invokes . To install GNU sed, please do this:
```
brew install gsed
```
and then add this line to your .bashrc:
```
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```
and then 'source .bashrc' or logout and log back in.
