To install esphome, do this:

git clone https://github.com/esphome/esphome.git
cd esphome.git
git checkout dev # optional - only if esphome dev branch preferred
./script/setup

To activate the python virtual environment in a terminal shell,
do this:

source venv/bin/activate

Now after cd-ing into this directory, it is possible to generate
yaml for the default project tag '0' using make, which produces
esphome yaml file proj.0.yaml.

To build for another project tag, pass PROJTAG=1 to your make command.

Once the yaml files are generated, it is also possible to issue esphome
commands directly on the generated yaml files, such as:

esphome compile proj.0.yaml
esphome upload  proj.0.yaml
esphome logs    proj.0.yaml

See 'esphome -h' for more details on esphome commands

Intermediate C-preprocessed files are stored in ./proj.<PROJTAG>
